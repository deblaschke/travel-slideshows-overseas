
TRAVEL PICTURE SLIDESHOWS README
--------------------------------

To view the slideshows, go to https://deblaschke.github.io/travel-slideshows-overseas/
in your favorite browser and select the slideshow of interest by clicking on
its thumbnail, which will enlarge when selectable.  The slideshow will open in
a new tab/window.  When the slideshow is complete (there are two standard closing
credit slides at the end) or you've had too much, close the tab/window.

Automatic slideshows have three control buttons below the pictures: previous
slide, pause/play, and next slide.  Manual slideshows only have the previous
slide and next slide buttons.  The left arrow (previous slide), right arrow
(next slide), and escape (pause/play) keys can be used in lieu of the control
buttons.

The slideshows have been tested on the following browsers:
- Firefox on Windows and macOS
- Chrome on Windows, macOS and Android (NOTE: Not perfectly responsive on mobile devices)
- Internet Explorer on Windows (NOTE: Might need to allow blocked content)
- Safari on macOS
- Edge on Windows

The following slideshow attibutes can be customized:

   1) Manual/Automatic

      In js/slideshow.js, change MANUAL_SLIDESHOW (default false) to desired
      value

      NOTE: This can be overridden on the URL through use of the mode query
      parameter, for example "?mode=manual"

   2) Interval

      In js/slideshow.js, change SLIDESHOW_INTERVAL (default 3000) to desired
      value in milliseconds

      NOTE: Only applicable if MANUAL_SLIDESHOW is false

      NOTE: This can be overridden on the URL through use of the interval query
      parameter, for example "?interval=1000"

   3) Range

      The beginning and/or ending picture can be set on the URL through use of
      the from/to query parameters, for example "?from=10&to=25" will display
      only pictures 010_* through 025_*

      NOTE: This is not intended for use with compilations
